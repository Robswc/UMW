    "Jiffy and Jaffy have an uncle named Jaqarue.  His given name is Jaque, but in college he did extensive field work in Austrailia studying kangaroos, where he recieved the nickname Jaqarue.  Jaqarue's speciality is Red Giant Kangaroos.  Jaffy is 19 years old and a sophmore at UMW.  Uncle Jaqarue is 49 years old.

    "Jiffy and Jaffy's Aunt Gingerbread is amazing at counting spots on giraffes.  Giraffe sports are mainly for camouflage, but they also contain a patchwork of blood vessels that cool a giraffe.  Aunt Gingerbread does not count spots one-by-one.  She looks at a giraffe and immediately knows how many spots are on it.  Many have asked Aunt Gingerbread to teach them her spot counting trick, but she doesn't know how she does it.  Aunt Gingerbread uses her spot counting to teach addition.  She counts the spots on two giraffes and teaches others how to add the spots.  Write a program that adds the spots of two giraffes.\n",
