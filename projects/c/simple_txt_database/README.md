# Simple C database (with txt files!)

This was part of a CPSC 305 assignment, which focused on utilizing pointers to create a simple, working database entirely in C.

The original specifications asked for a final program, capable of doing many standard database functions, such as adding, updating and removing entries.  The project covers pointers/arrays, file IO and multifile projects.

# Running

To run, compile with `gcc`.  Using the command `gcc main.c car.c`.
